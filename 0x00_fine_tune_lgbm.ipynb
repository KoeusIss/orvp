        "LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms. It is designed to be distributed and efficient with the following advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Faster training speed and higher efficiency.\n",
        "* Lower memory usage.\n",
        "* Better accuracy.\n",
        "* Support of parallel, distributed, and GPU learning.\n",
        "* Capable of handling large-scale data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will walk through a complete example of using automated hyperparameter tuning to optimize a _Light Gradient Boosting Model_. In particular, we will use Bayesian Optimization and the [Scikit Optimize](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/stable/index.html) library to tune the hyperparameters of the LGBM on the Optiver Realized Volatility Prediction competition.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Manual**: select hyperparameters based on intuition/experience/guessing, train the model with the hyperparameters, and score on the validation data. Repeat process until you run out of patience or are satisfied with the results.\n",
        "* **Grid Search**: set up a grid of hyperparameter values and for each combination, train a model and score on the validation data. In this approach, every single combination of hyperparameters values is tried which can be very inefficient!\n",
        "* **Random search**: set up a grid of hyperparameter values and select random combinations to train the model and score. The number of search iterations is set based on time/resources.\n",
        "* **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning**: use methods such as gradient descent, Bayesian Optimization, or evolutionary algorithms to conduct a guided search for the best hyperparameters.\n"
